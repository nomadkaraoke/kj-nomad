Tonight, I tried being a karaoke KJ at a new venue for the first time, and had a lot of technical challenges which made it difficult and far from ideal. My macbook's hdmi audio output was incompatible (stuttering) with the Denon AVR-3311CI AV receiver, so I ended up having to play videos from youtube on my phone, with an hdmi cable plugged into my phone instead...

If you agree with my idea of building a web app to solve this challenge (admin/controller view on my macbook, primary video player and second screen video player running on two different mini PCs playing the same content in perfect sync with each other), please research and brainstorm technical architectures for that and make a proposed plan for it, suitable for me to paste into my LLM assisted IDE and start building.

# **A Technical Plan for a Professional, Synchronized Karaoke Hosting System**

This report presents a comprehensive technical plan to address the challenges of creating a modern, stable, and professional Karaoke Jockey (KJ) system. It begins by analyzing the core requirements of such a system and evaluating two primary architectural pathways: a robust, off-the-shelf solution leveraging professional broadcast technology, and a detailed blueprint for a custom-built, synchronized web application. The analysis provides the necessary information to choose the most appropriate path and a detailed implementation guide for either choice.

## **Part 1: Foundational Analysis and Strategic Alternatives**

Before designing a solution, it is crucial to define the problem space. This involves establishing a clear set of features that constitute a professional KJ environment and articulating the fundamental technical challenge at the heart of the user's request: perfect multi-screen video synchronization.

### **Deconstructing the Professional KJ Environment: A Feature Analysis**

A successful KJ system is more than just a video player; it is a complete show management platform. To establish a baseline for a professional-grade solution, an analysis of leading commercial and open-source KJ software is necessary. This defines a target feature set and ensures any new system represents a genuine upgrade.

#### **Analysis of Existing Solutions**

The market for KJ software, while diverse, reveals a consistent set of core functionalities essential for professional use.

* **Karafun:** As a market leader, Karafun sets the standard for a modern, user-friendly, subscription-based karaoke experience.1 Its architecture is built around several key features that cater to both private parties and professional KJs. A fundamental feature is its native support for a dual-screen display, allowing lyrics to be shown on an external screen while the host manages the show from a primary control interface.4 Karafun's remote control system is particularly sophisticated, enabling guests to browse the song catalog and submit requests from their own smartphones via a web browser, typically initiated by scanning a QR code.7 For professional subscribers, this remote system includes advanced permissions management and a permanent QR code for venues.9 The platform also includes robust singer rotation management to ensure fair play 10 and professional-tier features like a customizable scrolling banner for announcements and custom logo branding on the video output.11  
* **OpenKJ:** Representing the open-source community, the OpenKJ Project provides a free, cross-platform solution that demonstrates the core needs of a traditional KJ.15 Built using the Qt framework for its user interface and the GStreamer multimedia framework for playback, it is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.18 Key features include singer rotation management, a scrolling ticker on the video display to show upcoming singers 19, and integration with a remote request server, allowing for web-based song submissions.15 Its reliance on a local media library (MP3+G, MP4, etc.) is typical of traditional KJ setups.16  
* **CompuHost & SongBoss:** These applications represent the more feature-dense, traditional KJ software aimed at professional hosts. A notable feature is the explicit support for a three-screen setup: a KJ control view, a singer lyrics view, and a dedicated "Crowd View" for displaying information like the singer queue and wait times.20 This highlights a sophisticated approach to information management during a show. Like other professional systems, they feature advanced singer rotation management and integrate with third-party online songbook and request systems, such as Songbooks Online.24

#### **Table 1: Feature Matrix of Professional KJ Software**

The following table synthesizes the feature sets of these representative platforms, providing a clear checklist for the development of a new professional system.

| Feature | Karafun (Pro) | OpenKJ | CompuHost / SongBoss |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Core Playback** |  |  |  |
| Dual-Screen Display | Yes 6 | Yes 26 | Yes (3-Screen) 21 |
| Local Media Playback | No (Streaming) | Yes 18 | Yes 24 |
| Streaming Catalog | Yes 11 | No | No (On-Demand Service) 24 |
| Key & Tempo Control | Yes 11 | Yes 18 | Yes 24 |
| **Show Management** |  |  |  |
| Singer Queue/Rotation | Yes 10 | Yes 27 | Yes 23 |
| Remote Song Requests | Yes (Web/QR) 8 | Yes (Web Integration) 18 | Yes (Web Integration) 24 |
| Singer History | Yes 11 | Yes 18 | Yes 24 |
| Filler Music Player | Yes | Yes 18 | Yes 24 |
| **Audience Display** |  |  |  |
| Singer Name on Screen | Yes 11 | Yes | Yes |
| Scrolling Ticker/Banner | Yes 14 | Yes 19 | Yes (Crowd View) 21 |
| Custom Logo/Branding | Yes 11 | No | Yes (Background Image) 24 |

An examination of these diverse systems reveals a common architectural pattern: the "Three-Screen Paradigm." Whether explicitly supported as in SongBoss 21 or implicitly through features in Karafun and OpenKJ, a professional setup separates information into at least three distinct contexts:

1. **The KJ Control View:** The host's private interface for managing the show (e.g., on the MacBook).  
2. **The Singer Lyrics View:** The primary video output focused on the performer.  
3. **The Audience Information View:** A secondary display for the crowd, often showing the singer rotation, a custom ticker message, or venue advertisements.14

This is a critical distinction. The goal is not merely to duplicate a single video feed. A truly professional system must be a multi-zone content manager, capable of sending different information overlays to different screens. The architecture must therefore be flexible enough to handle this, elevating the project from simple video mirroring to a more sophisticated content delivery platform.

### **The Core Technical Challenge: Multi-Device Video Synchronization**

The central requirement of the proposed system is to have two separate video players display the same content in perfect, frame-accurate synchronization. This is a non-trivial engineering problem that cannot be solved reliably with common off-the-shelf remote access tools.

#### **The Failure of Screen-Streaming Protocols**

Standard remote desktop protocols like VNC and RDP are fundamentally unsuited for high-fidelity, high-framerate video playback. These protocols were designed for remote system administration, not real-time media streaming.29 Their method of operation involves capturing the screen, compressing changed regions, and sending those image updates over the network. For full-motion video, where the entire screen is changing on every frame, this process is highly inefficient and results in significant lag, stuttering, poor image quality, and high CPU usage.29 This analysis validates the decision to move beyond these tools and pursue a custom solution.

#### **The Real Challenge: Synchronizing State, Not Pixels**

The correct approach is not to stream pixels from a source to two clients. Instead, the goal is to have two independent clients play the same media file (whether stored locally or streamed from a network source) and ensure their playback *states* are identical at all times. This means the isPlaying property (true/false) and the currentTime property (the video's timestamp) must be synchronized. Achieving this requires a robust protocol that can overcome three fundamental challenges inherent in networked systems:

1. **Clock Discrepancy:** The system clocks on the server and the two client PCs are not perfectly aligned. An action triggered at "10:00:00.000" on the server will correspond to different local times on each client. A protocol is needed to calculate the offset between each client's clock and the server's master clock to establish a common time reference.32  
2. **Network Latency and Jitter:** Commands sent from the server (e.g., "play," "pause") will travel across the network and arrive at each client at slightly different times. This variance, known as jitter, can cause the players to start or stop out of sync. The system must be designed to be resilient to this unpredictable delay.34  
3. **Playback Drift:** Even if two video players are started at the exact same moment, minuscule differences in their hardware, operating systems, and browser rendering engines can cause their playback clocks to drift apart over time. A 1ms difference per second becomes a noticeable 3.6-second gap after an hour. The system must therefore include a mechanism for periodic drift correction.36

The problem of keeping two video players synchronized is, in essence, a microcosm of the classic "consensus problem" in distributed computing. The system consists of multiple independent actors (the two player clients) that must agree on a shared state (the current video time) based on messages from a central coordinator (the backend server), all while communicating over an unreliable network.  
A naive approach where the server simply broadcasts "PLAY" and "PAUSE" commands is doomed to fail due to network latency; one client will inevitably receive the command before the other.35 A more robust solution requires the server to issue commands with timestamps, such as, "At server time  
X, the video's currentTime should be Y." This forces the client to perform clock synchronization to understand the server's time reference.32 This entire process of exchanging messages to agree on a state despite network imperfections is the fundamental challenge of distributed systems. Framing the problem in this way leads to a more resilient architecture that anticipates and handles edge cases like network lag, out-of-order messages, and temporary client disconnections.

## **Part 2: The Broadcast Workflow: An Off-the-Shelf Professional Solution with NDI**

Before embarking on the complex journey of building a custom synchronization protocol, it is prudent to evaluate an alternative solution that leverages established, professional-grade broadcast technology. Network Device Interface (NDI) offers a powerful, low-effort pathway to achieve perfect video synchronization using free, industry-standard software.

### **Architecture Overview using NDI**

NDI is a high-quality, low-latency IP video protocol developed by NewTek for use in professional video production environments.39 It is specifically designed to transmit broadcast-quality video and audio between devices on a local area network (LAN) with minimal delay. This technology can be harnessed to create an exceptionally stable and synchronized karaoke system.  
The proposed NDI workflow consists of three components:

1. **Control Machine (MacBook):** This machine runs OBS Studio, a free, open-source, and immensely powerful video production software.40 All karaoke video files are loaded and played as media sources within OBS. The KJ controls the entire show—playing, pausing, and switching videos—from the OBS interface.  
2. **Video Distribution (NDI Stream):** A free and widely used plugin, obs-ndi, is installed into OBS.39 This plugin allows the main program output from OBS to be broadcast as an NDI stream onto the local network.  
3. **Player Clients (Mini PCs):** Each of the two mini PCs runs a simple NDI receiver application. The free NDI Tools suite includes a program called "NDI Studio Monitor" which can discover any NDI stream on the network and display it full-screen.39

This architecture elegantly solves the core synchronization problem. The video is processed and rendered once on the control machine inside OBS. The resulting stream of video frames is then sent over the network. Both mini PCs receive the exact same NDI stream, ensuring they are always perfectly, frame-for-frame, in sync. This approach completely obviates the need to develop, test, and maintain a complex custom web-based synchronization protocol.

### **Implementation Guide and Feature Mapping**

Setting up the NDI workflow is straightforward and requires configuration rather than coding.

#### **Step-by-Step Setup**

1. **Install OBS Studio:** Download and install the latest version of OBS Studio on the control MacBook.  
2. **Install the NDI Plugin:** Download and install the obs-ndi plugin for OBS. This plugin has been downloaded over 1.7 million times and is a stable, well-supported tool.39  
3. **Configure OBS Output:** In OBS, navigate to Tools \> NDI Output Settings. Check the box for "Main Output" and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "KJ-Singer-Screen"). The OBS program output is now being broadcast as an NDI source on the network.39  
4. **Install NDI Tools:** On each of the two mini PCs, download and install the free NDI Tools package from NDI.tv.  
5. **Run NDI Studio Monitor:** Launch the "NDI Studio Monitor" application on both mini PCs. Right-click within the application, and the NDI source from the MacBook ("KJ-Singer-Screen") should appear in the list of available sources. Select it.

Both mini PCs will now display a perfect, synchronized mirror of the OBS program output from the MacBook.

#### **Mapping KJ Features to the NDI Workflow**

This workflow can replicate the key features of a professional KJ system:

* **Singer Display:** The OBS Program Output, displayed on the primary mini PC, serves as the main singer display.  
* **Secondary Display / Audience View:** The obs-ndi plugin also allows the OBS "Preview Output" to be sent as a *separate* NDI stream.39 The KJ can set up a different scene layout in the OBS preview window—for example, one that includes a ticker or a list of upcoming singers—and have the second mini PC display this preview stream, fulfilling the "Three-Screen Paradigm."  
* **Scrolling Ticker:** OBS has built-in text sources and filters that can create smoothly scrolling text overlays.42 More advanced tickers can be created with free third-party tools like WASP3D Xpress, which integrates with OBS via NDI.44  
* **Remote Requests:** A separate, simple web application can still be used for song requests. This application would display the requests on a webpage that the KJ can view on the MacBook. The KJ would then manually find the requested song in the OBS media library and add it to the playlist. The request system does not need to interface with the video playback directly.

### **Table 2: Decision Matrix: NDI Workflow vs. Custom Web Application**

The choice between the NDI workflow and a fully custom application involves significant trade-offs. This matrix provides a framework for making an informed decision based on project priorities.

| Criterion | NDI / OBS Workflow | Custom Web Application |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Development Effort** | **Very Low.** Configuration only. No custom code required for the core video system. | **Very High.** Requires backend, frontend, and complex synchronization protocol development. |
| **Cost** | **Free.** OBS Studio, the NDI plugin, and NDI Tools are all free software. | **Low (Software), High (Time).** Software is open-source, but development time is a significant cost. |
| **Synchronization Reliability** | **Extremely High.** Guaranteed frame-accurate sync handled by a mature, industry-standard protocol. | **Medium to High.** Depends entirely on the quality of the custom-built protocol. High risk of subtle bugs, drift, and latency issues. |
| **Flexibility & Customization** | **Medium.** Limited to the features and extensibility of OBS Studio. UI is fixed. | **Very High.** Complete control over every aspect of the UI, features, and user experience. |
| **Skillset Required** | Basic IT and broadcast software configuration. | Advanced full-stack web development, including real-time networking (WebSockets) and distributed systems concepts. |
| **Best For** | A KJ who needs a rock-solid, professional, and immediately deployable solution with guaranteed synchronization. | A developer who prioritizes ultimate control and a unique user experience, and is prepared for a significant and complex engineering project. |

## **Part 3: Architectural Blueprint for a Custom Synchronized Web Application**

Should the path of maximum flexibility and control be chosen, this section provides a detailed architectural blueprint for building the proposed custom web application. This design is intended to be robust, scalable, and suitable for implementation with the assistance of an LLM-powered IDE.

### **System Architecture Overview**

The system is composed of three primary components that communicate over two distinct channels, separating real-time control from general application data.

#### **Components**

1. **Backend Server (Node.js):** The central nervous system of the application. It acts as the single source of truth for all playback state, manages client connections, authenticates the admin controller, and serves media files to the players.  
2. **Admin Controller (Web App on MacBook):** The KJ's command center. This is a rich client-side application running in a browser on the MacBook. It provides the user interface for managing the song queue, singer rotation, and all playback controls (play, pause, seek, etc.).  
3. **Player Clients (Web App on Mini PCs):** Lightweight client-side applications running in a browser (in fullscreen/kiosk mode) on each of the two mini PCs. Their sole responsibilities are to render the video, listen for commands from the backend server, and execute those commands in perfect synchronization.

#### **Communication Channels**

* **REST API (HTTP/S):** This channel is used for standard, non-real-time request-response interactions. Examples include the Admin Controller fetching the initial song library list or a guest's phone submitting a new song request.  
* **WebSockets:** This is the real-time control plane. A persistent, bidirectional WebSocket connection is established between the backend server and *every* client (both the Admin Controller and the two Player Clients). All time-sensitive commands (play, pause, seek) and the crucial synchronization data are transmitted over this channel.

### **Backend Design (Node.js)**

The backend is the most critical component for ensuring synchronization. Its design must prioritize real-time performance and efficient data handling.

#### **Technology Stack Rationale**

* **Node.js:** Node.js is the superior choice over alternatives like Python for this specific application. Its core architecture is event-driven and non-blocking, making it exceptionally efficient at handling I/O-bound tasks, such as managing thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections and streaming file data.46 For a real-time application where the server's primary job is to shuffle messages between clients with minimal delay, Node.js's performance characteristics are ideal.48  
* **Express.js:** Express is a minimal, unopinionated, and widely-used web framework for Node.js.50 It will be used to structure the application, define the REST API endpoints for non-real-time actions, and serve the static files for the client-side applications.  
* **ws Library:** For the WebSocket server, the ws library is a high-performance, low-level choice that provides the necessary tools to build our custom control protocol without unnecessary abstraction.

#### **Efficient Media Serving**

Karaoke video files can be large, and the server must handle them efficiently without consuming excessive memory. A naive implementation that reads an entire file into memory before sending it will fail. The server must support **HTTP Range Requests**. This allows a web browser's \<video\> element to request specific byte ranges of a file, which is essential for seeking to a point in the middle of a video without downloading the entire preceding portion.  
This will be implemented as a dedicated endpoint in Express. When a request for a video file is received, the code will:

1. Check for a Range header in the request.  
2. If present, parse the start and end byte values.  
3. Use Node's built-in fs.createReadStream() method, passing the start and end options to read only the requested chunk from the disk.51  
4. Respond with a 206 Partial Content status code and set the appropriate headers: Content-Range, Accept-Ranges, and Content-Length to inform the browser about the chunk being sent.53  
5. Pipe the file stream directly to the response object, ensuring minimal memory usage on the server.

#### **The WebSocket Control Plane**

The server's primary real-time responsibility is to maintain and distribute the "source of truth" for playback. This state can be represented by a simple JavaScript object:

JavaScript

let playbackState \= {  
  songId: null,  
  isPlaying: false,  
  videoTimestamp: 0, // The official currentTime of the video  
  lastStateUpdate: 0 // The server's timestamp when the state was last changed  
};

When the Admin Controller sends a command (e.g., via a WebSocket message), the server first updates this internal playbackState object. It then immediately **broadcasts** the new, authoritative state to all connected Player Clients. This ensures that all players receive the same instructions originating from a single point of truth.

#### **Table 3: WebSocket Control Protocol Definition**

A formal protocol is essential for reliable communication. All messages will be JSON objects with a type and a payload.

| Message Type | Direction | Payload | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CMD\_PLAY | Admin \-\> Server | { "songId": "...", "startTime": 0 } | Command to start playing a specific song from a given time. |
| CMD\_PAUSE | Admin \-\> Server | {} | Command to pause the current video. |
| CMD\_SEEK | Admin \-\> Server | { "seekToTime": 123.45 } | Command to jump to a specific timestamp in the current video. |
| STATE\_UPDATE | Server \-\> Players | { "isPlaying": true/false, "songId": "...", "videoTimestamp": 123.45, "serverTimestamp": 167... } | Broadcast message informing players of the new authoritative state. Includes server time for latency calculation. |
| CLOCK\_SYNC\_REQUEST | Player \-\> Server | { "clientTime": 167... } | Player sends its local time to the server to initiate a clock sync calculation. |
| CLOCK\_SYNC\_RESPONSE | Server \-\> Player | { "clientTime": 167..., "serverTime": 167... } | Server responds immediately with the original client time and its own current time. |
| SYNC\_PULSE | Server \-\> Players | { "videoTimestamp": 123.45, "serverTimestamp": 167... } | Periodic broadcast used for continuous drift correction. |

### **Player Client Design (HTML5/JavaScript)**

The Player Client is where the synchronization logic is executed. It must be both responsive to server commands and intelligent enough to handle the realities of network communication and media playback.

#### **The Core Player**

The foundation of the player will be the standard HTML5 \<video\> element.54 This element provides a comprehensive JavaScript API (  
HTMLMediaElement) for programmatic control, which is more than sufficient for this project's needs and avoids the overhead of external libraries like Video.js.55 All default browser controls will be disabled by removing the  
controls attribute, ensuring that the application logic has exclusive control over playback.55 Key methods that will be used are  
video.play(), video.pause(), and setting the video.currentTime property.57

#### **The Synchronization Engine**

This is the most complex and critical part of the entire application. It will be encapsulated in a JavaScript class, SyncEngine, responsible for maintaining perfect synchronization with the server and the other player. Its operation is based on a four-part strategy.

##### **1\. Master Clock Synchronization (NTP-like Algorithm)**

The client cannot trust its own clock. It must know the server's time. On startup, and periodically thereafter, the SyncEngine will perform a clock synchronization routine to calculate the offset between its local Date.now() and the server's clock. This is a simplified version of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).33  
The process, modeled on libraries like timesync 38 and established algorithms 33, is as follows:

1. Record client start time: $t\_0 \= \\text{Date.now()}$.  
2. Send a CLOCK\_SYNC\_REQUEST message to the server, containing $t\_0$.  
3. The server receives the message at its time $t\_1$, and immediately sends a CLOCK\_SYNC\_RESPONSE containing the original $t\_0$ and its own reception time $t\_1$. Let's assume the server's processing time is negligible, so its transmission time is $t\_2 \= t\_1$.  
4. The client receives the response at its local time $t\_3 \= \\text{Date.now()}$.  
5. The client now has four timestamps and can calculate the round-trip delay ($\\delta$) and the clock offset ($\\theta$).  
   * Round-trip delay: $\\delta \= (t\_3 \- t\_0) \- (t\_2 \- t\_1)$  
   * Clock offset: $\\theta \= \\frac{((t\_1 \- t\_0) \+ (t\_2 \- t\_3))}{2}$  
6. This process is repeated several times (e.g., 5 times), and the result with the lowest round-trip delay is used to establish the most accurate offset.  
7. The SyncEngine now has a function, getSyncedTime(), which returns Date.now() \+ offset, providing a highly accurate estimate of the current server time.

##### **2\. Latency-Aware Command Execution**

When the player receives a STATE\_UPDATE command from the server, it cannot simply execute it blindly. The command includes the serverTimestamp at which the state change occurred. The player will use its getSyncedTime() function to determine the current server time and calculate the transit latency (transitTime \= getSyncedTime() \- command.serverTimestamp).  
If the command is to play from videoTimestamp: 50.0, the player knows this was true transitTime milliseconds ago. It will therefore set its video's currentTime to 50.0 \+ (transitTime / 1000), effectively compensating for the network lag and ensuring both players start from the same calculated point in time.35

##### **3\. Intelligent Buffering Strategy**

A crucial aspect of smooth playback is managing the video buffer, especially after a seek operation.62 A naive  
video.currentTime \= T; video.play(); will often result in stuttering if the required video data hasn't been downloaded yet. The SyncEngine will implement a more robust buffering strategy:

1. Upon receiving a command to seek to time T, it sets video.currentTime \= T.  
2. It then listens for the video element's seeked and canplay events.57 These events signal that the browser has successfully moved to the new position and has buffered enough data to begin playback without interruption.  
3. Only after the canplay event fires does the engine call video.play().  
4. This client-side event-driven approach ensures the player's state (playing/paused) always reflects its actual capability, preventing a poor user experience, especially over less reliable wireless networks.64

##### **4\. Continuous Drift Correction**

To combat the inevitable small drifts in playback between the two clients, the server will broadcast a SYNC\_PULSE message every few seconds (e.g., 5-10 seconds). This message contains the server's authoritative videoTimestamp and serverTimestamp.  
When a client's SyncEngine receives this pulse, it performs a drift correction check:

1. It calculates the expected video time: expectedTime \= pulse.videoTimestamp \+ ((getSyncedTime() \- pulse.serverTimestamp) / 1000).  
2. It compares this to the video's actual current time: actualTime \= video.currentTime.  
3. The difference is the drift: drift \= actualTime \- expectedTime.

Based on the magnitude of the drift, one of two correction methods is applied:

* **Soft Correction (Small Drift):** If the drift is minor (e.g., abs(drift) \< 0.2 seconds), a hard seek would be jarring. Instead, the engine subtly alters the video's playbackRate. If the client is behind (drift \< 0), it sets video.playbackRate \= 1.01. If it's ahead (drift \> 0), it sets it to 0.99. After a short period, it resets the rate to 1.0. This allows the player to catch up or slow down imperceptibly to the audience.36  
* **Hard Correction (Large Drift):** If the drift exceeds a threshold (e.g., abs(drift) \>= 0.2 seconds), the soft correction would take too long. The engine performs a hard correction by setting video.currentTime \= expectedTime, immediately snapping the player back into perfect sync.

### **Admin Controller Interface (React/Vue/Svelte)**

The Admin Controller is the KJ's user interface. While it can be built with plain JavaScript, using a modern frontend framework like React, Vue, or Svelte will greatly simplify the management of its complex state (song lists, singer queues, etc.).  
Its core functions are:

* Establishing a single, persistent WebSocket connection to the server.  
* Displaying the song library and the current singer queue.  
* Providing UI elements (buttons, sliders) for playback control. Each action (e.g., clicking "Pause") triggers a function that constructs the appropriate JSON message (e.g., { "type": "CMD\_PAUSE", "payload": {} }) and sends it to the server via the WebSocket.  
* Displaying a dedicated area for incoming song requests from the audience portal, allowing the KJ to approve and add them to the main queue.

## **Part 4: Implementation Roadmap and Feature Expansion**

This final part provides actionable guidance on hardware selection and step-by-step instructions for implementing key features that define the professional KJ experience.

### **Hardware Selection and Configuration**

The performance of the Player Client machines is critical for smooth, browser-based video playback. The choice of hardware should be driven by performance data for this specific use case.

#### **Recommendation: Intel N-Series Mini PCs over Raspberry Pi 5**

While the Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for many DIY and server projects, for the task of smooth 1080p video playback within a web browser, entry-level mini PCs based on Intel's N-series processors (e.g., N95, N97, N100) are the superior choice.67

* **Performance Analysis:** The Raspberry Pi 5's CPU, while powerful for general tasks, can struggle with the software-based video decoding required by web browsers for formats like VP9 used by YouTube, leading to dropped frames even at 1080p.69 In contrast, the integrated UHD graphics in Intel N-series SoCs are specifically designed for media decoding and handle 1080p and even 4K browser-based video playback effortlessly, with very few dropped frames.72 Benchmarks show a massive difference in GPU performance, with an N97 PC scoring over 9 times higher than a Pi 5 in GLMark2.72  
* **Value Analysis:** The initial low price of a bare Raspberry Pi 5 board is misleading. Once essential accessories are added—such as an official power supply, an active cooler, a case, and NVMe storage via a HAT—the total cost often meets or exceeds that of a ready-to-run N100 mini PC, which already includes RAM, an NVMe SSD, a power supply, and a case in its price.67 The mini PC offers better performance-per-dollar for this specific application.

#### **Table 4: Hardware Performance & Value: Mini PC vs. Raspberry Pi 5**

This table summarizes the key decision factors based on empirical data.

| Metric | Intel N100 Mini PC (e.g., Beelink S12 Pro) | Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB, Kitted) | Justification |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1080p Browser Video** | **Excellent.** Smooth playback with very few dropped frames.72 | **Fair.** Can struggle with 1080p60, noticeable dropped frames.70 | The Intel iGPU is better optimized for this task than the Pi's CPU-based browser decoding. |
| **CPU Performance (Sysbench)** | \~44,000 | \~40,000 | N100 is \~9% faster in raw CPU tasks.72 |
| **GPU Performance (GLMark2)** | \~2,070 | \~307 | N100 GPU is \~7x more powerful, critical for rendering.72 |
| **Power Consumption (Load)** | \~27W | \~9W | The Pi is significantly more power-efficient.72 |
| **All-in Cost (Approx.)** | \~$160 | \~$160+ | A fully equipped Pi 5 costs as much as a ready-to-use mini PC.72 |
| **Recommendation** | **Recommended.** Superior video playback performance and better overall value for this specific use case. | **Not Recommended.** Insufficient video performance for a professional, flawless display system. |  |

#### **Setup Guide**

For each mini PC, the recommended setup is:

1. Install a lightweight, modern Linux distribution such as Ubuntu Desktop.  
2. Install the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.  
3. Ensure all multimedia codecs are installed (ubuntu-restricted-extras package on Ubuntu).  
4. Configure the browser to launch in kiosk/fullscreen mode on startup, pointing to the URL of the Player Client application.

### **Building the Scrolling Ticker**

A scrolling ticker is a hallmark of a professional broadcast. This can be implemented on the Player Client application using standard web technologies.

1. **HTML/CSS:**  
   * Create a container div element with a fixed position at the bottom of the screen. Set its overflow property to hidden.  
   * Inside this container, place another div that will hold the text.  
   * Use a CSS @keyframes animation to continuously translate the inner div from right to left, creating a smooth scrolling effect.77 The  
     white-space: nowrap; property is essential to prevent the text from wrapping.  
2. **JavaScript/WebSocket Integration:**  
   * The text content of the ticker should not be static. The client's WebSocket listener will be programmed to handle a specific message type, such as UPDATE\_TICKER.  
   * The payload of this message will contain the new string of text for the ticker.  
   * When this message is received, the JavaScript will update the innerHTML of the scrolling div element. This allows the KJ to change the ticker text in real-time from the Admin Controller, for example, to display the next three singers in the queue, mirroring the functionality of software like OpenKJ and Karafun.14

### **Integrating a Song Request System**

To complete the professional experience, a system for audience members to request songs from their phones is essential. This can be built as a self-contained module within the application architecture.

1. **Song Library Database:** On the backend server, create a simple database of available songs. This can be a JSON file or a lightweight database like SQLite. A script can be written to scan the local media directory and populate this database with Artist, Title, and file path information, similar to how OpenKJ operates.18  
2. **Public Request Portal:** The Node.js server will host a simple, mobile-friendly webpage at a public URL (e.g., /request). This page will feature a search bar that, on input, calls a REST endpoint on the server (e.g., GET /api/search?q=...) to fetch matching songs from the database. Each search result will have a "Request" button that sends the song's ID in a POST request to an endpoint like /api/request.  
3. **Admin Integration:** The Admin Controller web app will have a dedicated section in its UI to display pending requests. This can be implemented by having the controller poll an endpoint like GET /api/requests or, more efficiently, by having the server push new requests to the Admin Controller over its existing WebSocket connection. The KJ can then approve requests, which adds the singer and song to the main rotation queue.

#### **Advanced Feature: YouTube Integration with yt-dlp**

To provide a virtually unlimited and always-current songbook, the system can be enhanced to handle YouTube links.

* **Integration:** The backend server can be configured with yt-dlp, a powerful command-line utility for downloading video and audio from thousands of websites.79  
* **Workflow:**  
  1. The public request portal is modified to accept a YouTube URL.  
  2. When a YouTube link is submitted, the backend server receives it.  
  3. The server invokes yt-dlp via a Node.js wrapper library like ytdlp-nodejs.80  
  4. yt-dlp downloads the video file to the server's local karaoke media directory.  
  5. The server then adds the new file to its song database, making it immediately available for the KJ to add to the queue and play.

## **Conclusions and Recommendations**

The analysis presents two viable but distinct paths toward achieving a professional, synchronized karaoke hosting system.  
Recommendation 1: For Immediate, Guaranteed Results, Adopt the NDI/OBS Workflow.  
If the primary goal is to have a rock-solid, perfectly synchronized multi-screen video system running as quickly as possible, the NDI-based workflow is the unequivocally superior choice. It leverages free, mature, industry-standard broadcast software to solve the core synchronization problem at the protocol level. The development effort is negligible, shifting from complex coding to straightforward software configuration. This path provides a professional-grade result with the highest degree of reliability.  
Recommendation 2: For Ultimate Control and a Unique Product, Build the Custom Web Application.  
If the goal is to create a fully customized user experience and to have complete ownership over every feature and interface element, then building the proposed web application is the correct path. This report provides a detailed and robust architectural blueprint for such a project. However, this path must be undertaken with a clear understanding of its complexity. The development of the synchronization engine is a significant engineering challenge that requires expertise in real-time networking and distributed systems concepts.  
Final Hardware Recommendation:  
Regardless of the chosen software path, the analysis strongly indicates that for the player clients, entry-level Intel N-series mini PCs are a better investment than Raspberry Pi 5s. They offer demonstrably superior browser-based video playback performance for a comparable all-in cost, ensuring the visual output of the karaoke system is smooth and professional.

\---------------

to quote from you:

"An examination of these diverse systems reveals a common architectural pattern: the "Three-Screen Paradigm." Whether explicitly supported as in SongBoss or implicitly through features in Karafun and OpenKJ, a professional setup separates information into at least three distinct contexts:

The KJ Control View: The host's private interface for managing the show (e.g., on the MacBook).

The Singer Lyrics View: The primary video output focused on the performer.

The Audience Information View: A secondary display for the crowd, often showing the singer rotation, a custom ticker message, or venue advertisements.

This is a critical distinction. The goal is not merely to duplicate a single video feed. A truly professional system must be a multi-zone content manager, capable of sending different information overlays to different screens. The architecture must therefore be flexible enough to handle this, elevating the project from simple video mirroring to a more sophisticated content delivery platform."

what if we built a web-based (but ideally still works fully offline) solution which basically cuts out the work for the kj completely, automating pretty much everything except for entering inputs (name, artist/song as spoken/written/typed by drunk singers, karaoke video search, admin interventions e.g. skipping singer, bumping someone up the queue, deleting singer if they're known to have gone home, etc.)

essentially making the entire job of "KJ Control View" much simpler and something the KJ could do easily from a minimal phone web ui.

is this realistic? can you think of a software/devops architecture which would be realistic to do this?

Yes, this is a very realistic and powerful vision. Moving towards a fully automated, offline-first system where the KJ acts as a simple moderator is the logical evolution of the professional karaoke setup. It shifts the host's focus from tedious technical operations to engaging with the crowd, which is the core of a great karaoke night.  
The architecture to achieve this would be a self-contained, local-network-native system. Let's call it the "Karaoke-in-a-Box" model. The entire system would run from a single application on your MacBook, requiring no internet connection to operate during the event, and would be accessible by any device with a web browser on the local network.  
Here is a realistic software and DevOps architecture to build this system.

### **Architectural Blueprint: The "Karaoke-in-a-Box" PWA**

The system is a client-server model that operates entirely on the local network. The "server" is a single application you run on your MacBook, and the "clients" are simply web browsers on the mini PCs, your phone, and the singers' phones.

#### **1\. The Core Server (Running on the MacBook)**

This is the heart of the system. It would be a **Node.js application packaged into a single, double-clickable executable** using a tool like pkg.1 This is the key to simplifying the "DevOps" — there's no complex setup. You just run one file.  
This single application would be responsible for:

* **Web Server:** Serving the Progressive Web App (PWA) to all clients (the players, your phone, and the audience's phones).2  
* **Real-Time Communication:** Running a WebSocket server to push state changes instantly to all connected clients. When you skip a singer on your phone, the player screens react immediately without needing to refresh.3  
* **Service Discovery (Zero-Configuration):** The server would advertise itself on the local network using **Bonjour/mDNS**, the same technology Apple uses for AirPlay.4 This is crucial for ease of use. The player clients and your phone's admin UI wouldn't need to know the MacBook's IP address; they would automatically discover the "Karaoke Service" on the network.5  
* **State Management:** Maintaining the "single source of truth" for the singer rotation queue, current song playback status, and filler music state.  
* **Media Library & Search:** Managing the database of song metadata (artist, title, file path) and providing an API for searching. For handling misspelled or "drunk" search queries, it would use a fuzzy-search library like **Fuse.js**, which is excellent at finding approximate matches.7  
* **File Serving:** Streaming the video files directly from your 4TB SSD to the player clients over the local network.

#### **2\. The Frontend: A Unified Progressive Web App (PWA)**

This is what everyone interacts with. It's a single web application that presents different views based on who is accessing it. The entire PWA would be built with an "offline-first" methodology.2

* **Service Workers:** The PWA would use a Service Worker to aggressively cache all its assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).11 This means that after the first visit, the app loads instantly, even if the MacBook's server is momentarily unavailable on the network. The Service Worker acts as a proxy, intercepting network requests and serving cached files first, making the application incredibly resilient.13  
* **Offline Data Storage:** The application state, like the current singer queue, would be stored locally on each client using **IndexedDB**. This is a powerful in-browser database capable of storing large amounts of structured data.15 If a player PC briefly loses Wi-Fi, it will still know the current queue and can seamlessly reconnect to the WebSocket stream.

The PWA would have three primary interfaces:

1. **The Player Interface (Mini PCs):** This is the simplest view. It loads in a browser set to fullscreen/kiosk mode. Its only job is to connect to the WebSocket server, receive commands (e.g., "play video X at timestamp Y"), and display the video and ticker information.  
2. **The Singer Self-Service Interface (Audience Phones):**  
   * **Access:** A QR code displayed on the main screens would link to this interface.17  
   * **Functionality:** A simple, mobile-first UI where singers can search the song library (powered by the fuzzy search on the server) and add themselves and their chosen song to the queue. This completely automates the request-taking process.  
3. **The KJ Control Interface (Your Phone):**  
   * **Design:** A minimalist UI designed for quick, one-handed operation.21 It would focus on the few essential manual interventions needed.  
   * **Functionality:** View the rotation, drag-and-drop to reorder singers, remove a singer who has left, and override the current song (play/pause/skip).

#### **3\. The Automation Engine**

The server application would handle the logic that removes the KJ's workload.

* **Automated Singer Rotation:** The system would use a fair-play rotation algorithm. Once a singer's song finishes, the system automatically moves them to the bottom of the queue and loads the next singer's track.24 This logic is a core feature of professional KJ software and is straightforward to implement.  
* **Automated Filler Music:** A dedicated playlist of "bumper music" would be managed by the server. The system would detect when the karaoke player is idle (between singers) and automatically start playing from this list, fading it out as soon as the next karaoke track begins.27

### **Is This Realistic?**

**Yes, this architecture is entirely realistic and highly achievable with modern web technologies.** It directly addresses the core challenges of offline operation, local network discovery, and real-time control while drastically simplifying the deployment and operation for the end-user (you).  
By packaging the server as a single executable and using a PWA for all interfaces, you create a powerful, self-contained ecosystem that requires no installation on client devices and is resilient to the exact kind of network instability you're facing. This approach transforms the complex task of managing a multi-screen, synchronized karaoke show into a simple, automated, and enjoyable experience.
