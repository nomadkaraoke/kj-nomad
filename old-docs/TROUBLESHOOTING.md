3. **Check the startup message**: Note the IP address and port displayed
4. **Try localhost first**: Go to `http://localhost:8080` on the host computer

## üåê Network Connection Issues

### Devices Can't Connect to KJ-Nomad

**Symptoms:**
- Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
- Player screens show loading forever
- Mobile devices can't access KJ control

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Network Connection**
   ```
   ‚úÖ All devices connected to same WiFi network
   ‚úÖ WiFi network is working (test with internet browsing)
   ‚úÖ No "guest" or isolated networks being used
   ```

2. **Check IP Address**
   - Look at KJ-Nomad startup window for correct IP
   - Try both IP address AND `localhost:8080` on host computer
   - IP typically looks like: `192.168.1.100:8080` or `10.0.0.50:8080`

3. **Firewall Issues**

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Another application might be using port 8080
   - Restart your computer to free up ports
   - Try accessing with different port if configured

### WiFi Network Problems

**Create a Dedicated Network:**
1. Use a mobile hotspot or dedicated router
