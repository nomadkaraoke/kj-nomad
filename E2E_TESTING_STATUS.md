# E2E Testing Status Report

## Summary

The end-to-end tests have made significant progress! We've resolved the major server HTTP hanging issues and frontend/backend communication problems. Tests are now getting "much further" and making real progress.

## âœ… Major Fixes Completed (Latest Session)

### ðŸš¨ **Critical Server Issues Resolved**
1. **Server HTTP Hanging Issue**: 
   - **Root Cause**: Infinite loop in `/api/queue/clear` endpoint
   - **Problem**: `while (queue.length > 0)` loop never terminated because `removeSongFromQueue()` modified global queue but local reference stayed unchanged
   - **Fix**: Replaced infinite loop with direct `resetQueue()` call
   - **Impact**: Tests can now run without server freezing

2. **Frontend/Backend Communication**:
   - **Problem**: Vite dev server on port 5173 couldn't reach backend API on port 8080
   - **Fix**: Added Vite proxy configuration to forward `/api/*` requests to `localhost:8080`
   - **Impact**: API calls now work properly, server logs show successful requests

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - **Problem**: WebSocket trying to connect through Vite proxy instead of directly to server
   - **Fix**: Configure WebSocket to connect directly to `ws://localhost:8080`
   - **Impact**: Real-time features now working, WebSocket connections stable

### ðŸ›  **Development Experience Improvements**
4. **Convenience Scripts**: Created root `package.json` with `npm run dev` to start both server and client simultaneously
5. **Reduced Development Noise**: Cleaned up WebSocket logging to reduce console spam during page reloads
6. **Comprehensive Server Logging**: Added detailed logging to all API endpoints for easier debugging

## âœ… Previously Completed Fixes

1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Fixed import issues in Cypress support files
2. **Data Test IDs**: Added all necessary `data-testid` attributes to UI components:
   - SingerPage: `singer-name-input`, `song-search-input`, `song-result`
   - ControllerPage: `play-next-button`, `queue-item`, `ticker-input`, `update-ticker-button`, `now-playing`
   - PlayerPage: `video`, `now-playing` (displays singer info)
   - Ticker component: `ticker`
3. **Routing Issues**: Fixed test navigation from `/#/route` to `/route` format
4. **Test Media Files**: Created real video files using FFmpeg instead of placeholder text files
5. **UI Text Matching**: Updated SingerPage header to "Search for a song" to match test expectations
6. **Queue Management**: Added `/api/queue/clear` endpoint and queue clearing between tests
7. **CI Configuration**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow to:
   - Install FFmpeg for real test videos
   - Build frontend before starting server
   - Copy frontend build to server public directory
   - Use proper test data setup script

## ðŸŸ¡ Current Status

**Tests are now getting "much further"** - the major blocking issues have been resolved:
- âœ… Server no longer hangs on HTTP requests
- âœ… API endpoints working properly (confirmed via server logs)
- âœ… WebSocket connections stable
- âœ… Frontend/backend communication established

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Run Tests Again**: Now that server communication is fixed, run tests to identify remaining specific UI/interaction issues
2. **Debug Remaining Test Failures**: Focus on specific test steps that fail rather than infrastructure issues
3. **Verify E2E Test Scenarios**: Ensure test scenarios match actual UI behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings

1. **Server-side infinite loops**: Always verify loop termination conditions, especially when modifying arrays during iteration
2. **Development vs Production**: Different port configurations between dev and production require proper proxy setup
3. **WebSocket proxy complexity**: Sometimes direct connections work better than proxy configurations
4. **Debugging strategy**: Adding comprehensive logging to all endpoints makes debugging much easier

## ðŸš€ Current Development Setup

**Working Configuration:**
- **Server**: `npm run dev` in `/server` (port 8080)
- **Client**: `npm run dev` in `/client` (port 5173 with proxy to 8080)
- **Convenience**: `npm run dev` from root runs both simultaneously
- **API Communication**: âœ… Working via Vite proxy
- **WebSocket Communication**: âœ… Working via direct connection
- **E2E Tests**: Ready to run without infrastructure blocking issues
