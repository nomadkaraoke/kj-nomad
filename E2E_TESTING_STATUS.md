# E2E Testing Status Report

## Summary

The end-to-end tests have been significantly improved but still need some final fixes to work completely in CI.

## âœ… Completed Fixes

1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Fixed import issues in Cypress support files
2. **Data Test IDs**: Added all necessary `data-testid` attributes to UI components:
   - SingerPage: `singer-name-input`, `song-search-input`, `song-result`
   - ControllerPage: `play-next-button`, `queue-item`, `ticker-input`, `update-ticker-button`, `now-playing`
   - PlayerPage: `video`, `now-playing` (displays singer info)
   - Ticker component: `ticker`
3. **Routing Issues**: Fixed test navigation from `/#/route` to `/route` format
4. **Test Media Files**: Created real video files using FFmpeg instead of placeholder text files
5. **UI Text Matching**: Updated SingerPage header to "Search for a song" to match test expectations
6. **Queue Management**: Added `/api/queue/clear` endpoint and queue clearing between tests
7. **CI Configuration**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow to:
   - Install FFmpeg for real test videos
   - Build frontend before starting server
   - Copy frontend build to server public directory
   - Use proper test data setup script

## ðŸŸ¡ Remaining Issues

1. **Route Resolution**: Tests can't find UI elements, suggesting routing or server configuration issues
2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: The built frontend may not be properly served by the server
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Real-time features like ticker updates aren't working correctly in tests

## ðŸ“‹ Test Results

- **automation_flow.cy.ts**: 1/6 tests passing
- **main_flow.cy.ts**: 0/5 tests passing

One test ("pauses when no songs or filler music are available") is consistently passing, proving the test infrastructure works.

## ðŸš€ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Debug Server Configuration**: Ensure the server correctly serves the built React app
2. **Test Route Handling**: Verify React Router works correctly when served by Express
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Test real-time features in isolation
4. **Simplified Test Suite**: Create minimal passing tests to establish CI baseline

## ðŸ›  CI Integration

The CI workflow has been updated to:
- Install FFmpeg and create real test videos
- Build and serve the frontend correctly  
- Wait for server startup before running tests
- Capture test videos and screenshots on failure

The main issue preventing CI success is likely that the Express server needs to be configured to properly serve the React SPA with client-side routing.
