# KJ-Nomad: Implemented Features Status

This document provides an accurate overview of what features have actually been implemented in the KJ-Nomad project, versus what is documented or planned.

## 🎭 **Dual-Mode Architecture Overview**

KJ-Nomad supports two distinct deployment modes:

**🏠 Local Mode**: Offline-first system for venues with unreliable internet. KJ runs a self-contained executable, manages paper requests manually, and controls multiple synchronized player screens via local network.
